"""v0 experimental lineup-fit + season simulation for CourtBuilder.

Explicitly a labeled placeholder (config.SIMULATOR_VERSION = "...v0"-family),
not a calibrated model (master plan Sec 12.8) -- produces a plausible seeded
record and an expected-wins range from lineup-fit components derived from the
same LineupDNA fields Peak Draft's own experimental model already computes
per card (nba_peak.lineup.schemas.CardProfile.lineup_dna), never from a new
or approximated PEAK3 score (ADR-005 Decisions 3-4).

PEAK3 product philosophy, binding for every component computed here: this is
a game about PEAK VALUE. A roster is never mechanically punished just for
having a lot of elite all-time peaks -- there is no "too many stars," "role
redundancy," or "anti-GOAT" penalty anywhere in this module. If a player
legitimately drafts Magic, Jordan, Bird, Duncan, and Shaq, that roster
projects as historically dominant, full stop. The only things that move the
projection away from pure peak talent are real basketball constraints:
whether starters are placed at a position they actually played
(`positional_fit`, computed from nba_peak.perfect_season.positions), and
whether the bench carries real talent (`bench_strength`). Cross-era
combinations are never penalized for being cross-era. Uncertainty in the
projection comes from this being an uncalibrated v0 heuristic (see
SIMULATOR_EXPERIMENTAL_NOTICE), never from a hidden game-balance nerf.
